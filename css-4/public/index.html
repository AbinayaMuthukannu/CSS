                make a transition and
                have
                heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
                incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time
                of my
                life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at
                a VR
                startup.</p>

            <h3> Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
            <p style="opacity: 70%; letter-spacing: 1px;"> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
                structure from
                professionals
                who
                can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs
                who
                can
                only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                They
                were
                very
                hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                outstanding. It
                took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often
                referred
                to it
                during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
                full-stack
                developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
